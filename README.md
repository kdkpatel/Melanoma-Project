Melanoma Prediction usnig CNN
Melanoma has become more common in India in recent years, and early detection is a key element in lowering mortality rates. Having access to an automatic, dependable technology that can detect melanoma via a dermatoscopic image of lesions and/or skin pigmentation can be a highly important tool in medical diagnosis. The method proposed in this project consists of a first step automatically clipping the region of interest in dermatoscopic images using mask and region based Convolutional Neural Network technique and a second step based on model predictive analytics makes predictions (as a percentage) in the output.

-Melanoma begins when healthy melanocytes change and grow out of control, forming a serious tumor. Sometimes melanoma develops from a normal mole that a person already has on their skin. When this happens, the mole will have changes that are usually visible, such as changes in the shape, size, color, or outline of the mole./
-Melanoma can also appear on areas that are less exposed to the sun, such as the soles of the feet, palms, and fingernails. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin./
-Melanoma may not be the same color as a mole. It may be colorless or reddish, this is called melanotic melanoma. Melanoma develops from the rapid growth of melanin-producing cells, melanocytes, found in the epidermis of the skin.
